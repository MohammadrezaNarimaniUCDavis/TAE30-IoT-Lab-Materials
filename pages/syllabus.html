        <h4>Makeup exam for legitimate absences</h4>
        <p>Suppose you are going to miss an exam for legitimate reasons, such as a medical emergency and a medical condition related to pregnancy or COVID-19. In that case, you must (i) give the earliest possible advance notice to me, and (ii) provide information to explain the legitimate reasons for your absence. I will then determine whether to grant an excused absence and how to make arrangements for makeup work, considering all related factors such as the information you provided.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Absences and Late Policy</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>You are allowed to have ONLY ONE LATE SUBMISSION of any assignments within two days after the due date without losing any points. Except for this one-time grace period, you will lose 20% of points per day you submit the assignment late. In other words, you need to submit your assignment within four days after the due date to be considered for grading. Only under legitimate circumstances (such as a medical emergency and a medical condition related to pregnancy or COVID-19), late submissions will be graded without penalties.</p>
