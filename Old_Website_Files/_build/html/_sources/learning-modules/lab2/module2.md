### Instructions
- Create a script that:
  1. Gets a number from users, and
  2. Identifies if the number is odd or even.
  3. Prints the outcome in the terminal (e.g., "This is an EVEN number!")
- Save your code on your computer periodically.
- Submit your code saved as a *.svg file.

### What to Submit
- Submit your code saved as a *.svg file.

## Instruction and Hints
- The script should have two main blocks:
  - Main block, in which there are
    - A continuous loop (use *repeat forever* block) asking users to enter a number (use *terminal receive* block).
    - Call a function that identifies if this is an even or odd number.
    - At the beginning of this block, you may want to add a new line (use *terminal new line* block) and a text block that prompts users to enter a number (use *terminal print text* block).
  - Your function block, which
    - Identifies if this is an odd or even number.
    - Prints the outcome in the terminal (e.g., "This is an ODD/EVEN number.").

- **Hints:**
  - To identify if a number is odd or even, you need to check the remainder when you divide the number by 2. If a number is evenly divisible by 2 with no remainder (remainder is equal to zero), then it is even, otherwise, it is odd (remainder is not equal to zero). You can use the *math operation* block and change it to *remainder after division* in the mutation window (gear icon).
  ![Hint](../../images/book/learning-modules/lab2_pic1.png)
  - Use if statement to check if the remainder is equal to zero or not:
    - If remainder = 0 -> this is an even number.
    - If remainder â‰  0 -> this is an odd number.
  - You may want to add comments to your code to make your code more readable, make code maintenance much easier, and help others better understand your code.
