The WX version of the Propeller Activity Board expands upon the functionality of the original (#32910). There’s more current for your projects with independent 1.8 amp 3.3 V and 5 V switching regulators, an upgrade from audio-out-only to a Mini TRRS audio/video (or audio/mic) jack, and selectable wireless socket/USB communication between host computer and the Propeller chip (RF module not included!)

## Features
- Built-in 8-core Propeller P8X32A microcontroller, 64 KB EEPROM, and 5 MHz crystal oscillator
- Solder-free prototyping with breadboard and header sockets for power and I/O
- Six servo/sensor ports with power-select jumpers
- Automatically selects between USB and external power sources and provides USB over-current protection
- Center-positive 2.1 mm barrel jack for external power supplies
- Convenient reset button and 3-position power switch
- Onboard mini stereo-audio jack with microphone/video pass-through
- Built-in microSD card slot for data logging or storing WAV files
- Wireless Module socket accepts RF modules to simplify remote management
- Dedicated analog header sockets provide four A/D 12-bit inputs and two buffered variable-resolution D/A outputs
- Indicator lights show the status of system power, servo power, programming source, DAC output levels, wireless communication activity, and USB communication activity
- 3.3 V and 5 V switching voltage regulators with independent 1.8 amp outputs
