**What is PAR?**

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which is solar radiation ranging from 400 to 700 nm, is the most important energy source for crops, used by them for photosynthesis. A low or high PAR intensity can deteriorate photosynthesis; hence, it may become a stress factor.

# Background 

Sensor calibration is required to ensure accurate measurements by the sensor. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the sensor's error, i.e., to minimize the difference between the measured value by the sensor and the actual value of the quantity being measured.

The purpose of calibration is to find or update the characteristic curve, which defines the relationship between the quantity being measured and the sensor's output. Calibration must be performed in a timely manner to prevent performance degradation and ensure accurate measurements. The performance of the sensor tends to degrade over time and change depending on the working environment; therefore, revisiting the characteristic curve is necessary.

# Multi-point curve fitting 

The objective of this assignment is to calibrate the PAR sensor, which returns the raw number. The goal is to find a characteristic curve that maps the light intensity in Âµmol/(m^2^s) to the sensor's output. Here are the calibration steps:

1.  Take a few measurements with the PAR sensor, preferably one near the low end, one near the high end, and a few measurements in between. For the low-light intensity measurement, we can keep the cap on the sensor and take a measurement. Then, we can take measurements at various locations and times with different light intensities. For example, one measurement can be taken outside around noon, when the light intensity is at its maximum, and another in the shade.

2.  Repeat the above measurements with the reference instrument, which can be a calibrated sensor. These are the actual values for our measurements. Please note that each measurement at this step should be taken simultaneously and under the same conditions as the corresponding measurement in Step 1.

. How to fit a linear trendline in Excel and get the equation.

At this point, we fitted a linear model/function (y = Ax + B) that defines the relationship between light intensity and the output of the PAR sensor. This is the characteristic curve of this PAR sensor. In this equation, 'x' denotes light intensity, and 'y' refers to the sensor output.

- Calculate the inverse of the equation returned by Excel. The inverse model maps the sensor output (x) to light intensity (y).

Here is an example:

> y = 3x + 4 ðŸ¡º this is f(x).
>
> 3x = y -- 4
>
> x = (y-4)/3
>
> x = (1/3)y -- 4/3
>
> swap x and y:
>
> y = (1/3)x -- 4/3 ðŸ¡º this is the inverse of our function f(x).

- Using the inverse model, complete the following table by calculating the light intensity for the following sensor's measurements:

# Two-point calibration

Use the first and last row of Table 1 (the two extreme values) to find a new calibration model using the two-point calibration equation (for more information, please refer to the slides):

$$corrected\ value = (raw\ value\  - RawLow) \times \left( \frac{ReferenceRange}{RawRange} \right) + ReferenceLow$$

Please note that RawLow and ReferenceLow are both equal to zero (Table 1), so the equation becomes:

$$corrected\ value = (raw\ value\ ) \times \left( \frac{ReferenceRange}{RawRange} \right)$$

We can even further simplify the equation by plugging the range values. Now, you can calculate the calibrated value using the following equation:

$$\ corrected\ value = \left( \frac{1707}{376} \right)\  \times (raw\ value\ )$$

- Using the equation obtained by two-point calibration, complete the table again:

  : . Calibrated values for sensor output calculated based on the two-point calibration method vs actual measurements.

- Calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) for the two calibration techniques using the following equation:

*\*
$$RMSE = \ \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{(y_{i}\  - \ {\widehat{y}}_{i})}^{2}}$$

$$y_{i}:\ Actual\ measurement\ $$

$${\widehat{y}}_{i}:\ Calibrated\ values\ for\ sensor\ output\ $$

How to do it in Excel:

- Add a new column and raise the error to the power of 2.

- Calculate the sum of the errors you raised to the power of 2.

- Divide the sum by the total number of samples, which is 5 in this case.

- Calculate the square root of the value you obtained after dividing by 5.
