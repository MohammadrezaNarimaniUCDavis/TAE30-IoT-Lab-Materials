# Accommodations and Accessibility

> *UC Davis is committed to educational equity in the academic setting, and in serving a diverse student body. I encourage all students who are interested in learning more about the Student Disability Center (SDC) to contact them directly at [[https://sdc.ucdavis.edu]{.underline},](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/) email at [[sdc@ucdavis.edu]{.underline},](mailto:sdc@ucdavis.edu) or call 530-752- 3184.

# Mental Health and Wellness

> As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, depression, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student\'s ability to participate in daily activities. UC Davis offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, consider utilizing the confidential mental health services available on campus. I encourage you to reach out to the Counseling Center for support: [[https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/services/counseling-services]{.underline}](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/services/counseling-services) or call 530-752-0871. An on campus counselor or after-hours clinician is available 24/7.

# Connecting with instructor/TA during Office Hours

> We are here to support your learning. We encourage you to meet with us when you feel that you need support or assistance.
>
> Never attended office hours? Don't know where or how to start the conversation? Here are some tips
>
> for getting the most out of office hours:

- Office hours are great for getting guidance on specific questions, problem-solving tips, etc.

  - Bring one question from the lecture, reading, or homework to office hours. During office

> hours ask: "Am I getting/doing this correctly"?

- Office hours are great for helping to clarify course concepts.

  - Find one line or a single concept from the course material that catches your attention--- maybe it's a super interesting concept and/or maybe it's something that's still a bit confusing. During office hours say: "I found XX really interesting in class today. Can you explain a bit more about this concept to help me put it into context?"

- Office hours can also be about getting to know the professor.

  - During office hours say: "I found the lecture on XX really interesting. How did you get interested in this topic"?

- Professors can connect you to lots of other resources, e.g., academic advisors, tutors, and/or success coaching.

  - During office hours say: "I am doing the problems and homework but sometimes I forget how to do XX. Can you recommend some study strategies or refer me to tutors or other campus resources that could help review material \[or study more effectively; or provide some general test taking strategies; etc.\] for this class"?

- Professors can give advice on related classes or research in specific areas.

  - During office hours say: "I'm interested in learning more about topic XX. Are there other classes you could recommend that could help me expand my knowledge in this area"?

- Professors can provide guidance on internships and career paths.

  - During office hours say: "I'm really interested in XX field that we discussed in class. Do you have ideas or tips on internships or research opportunities that could give me experience in this area"?

- Bring a friend from the class along---sometimes having a couple of people to share the questions and conversations can make it easier to ask questions and get the conversation started!

# How to Practice Self-Care

> I support the UC Davis goals for student self-care:
>
> *You deserve respect and are encouraged to [[practice self-care]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nYzSW9qAn6hGd3S_ZK76pI2F8JydP9_3/view) so that you can remain focused and engaged; that might mean getting a drink of water, leaving to use the restroom, taking a moment to stretch, or doing something else you need to do to take care of yourself. Please be respectful of others by minimizing distractions when practicing self-care -- especially in lab, field or studio settings where safety is imperative. College life can be overwhelming at times, but know that you are not alone if you're feeling stressed. For many of us, systems of oppression such as racism, sexism, heterosexism or cissexism may cause additional stress. Please remember to practice self-care and reach out for support if and when you need it. You can visit [[Virtual UC Davis]{.underline}](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/virtual-ucdavis) to find resources related to health and well-being, academics, basic needs (food and housing), and more.*
